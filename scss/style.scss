IMPORTING PARTIALS
These files are needed at the beginning so that we establish all
our mixins, functions, and variables that we'll be using across
the whole project.
*********************/

// Sass variables
@import "partials/variables";

// typography
@import "partials/typography";


/*********************
BASE (MOBILE) SIZE
This are the mobile styles. It's what people see on their phones. If
you set a great foundation, you won't need to add too many styles in
the other stylesheets. Remember, keep it light: Speed is Important.
*********************/
// styles in base.scss
@import "breakpoints/base";

/*********************
LARGER MOBILE DEVICES
This is for devices like the Galaxy Note or something that's
larger than an iPhone but smaller than a tablet. Let's call them
tweeners.

you can add resource intensive styles.
